# STAC CARD4L Extensions

This repository contains two STAC extensions that specifies how to create STAC Items (and Collections)
that comply to the [CEOS CARD4L](http://ceos.org/ard/) product family specifications for either:
- Optical - Surface Reflectance
- Optical - Surface Temperature
- SAR - Normalized Radar Backscatter
- SAR - Polarimetric Radar

There are two STAC extensions, one for Optical and one for SAR:
- [Optical](optical/README.md)
- [SAR](sar/README.md)

## Disclaimer

The extensions are work in progress. The specification in the Markdown files should be mostly finished,
but JSON Schemas and examples are missing. Links may be defect at the moment as STAC v1.0.0 RC1 has not been released yet.

The extensions are not officially approved by CEOS, but there's a desire to get CEOS approval.

The extensions were written as part of the project [openEO Platform](https://platform.openeo.org)
with funding from [ESA](https://www.esa.int).
